# Chainlink Price Feeds on Solana

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that currently provides decentralization at both the oracle and data source level. By using multiple independent Chainlink nodes, the user can defend against one oracle being a single point of failure. Similarly, using multiple data sources for sourcing market prices, the user can defend against one data source being a single source of truth.

This project demonstrates how to use the [Chainlink Price Data Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/using-chainlink-reference-contracts/) to enable Solana Rust programs to retrieve the latest pricing data of an asset in a single call.

We are going to:

* write and deploy a Rust Program on the Solana [Devnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters)
* Retrieve data feeds using the Solana Web3 JavaScript API using Node

## Quick Start

The following dependencies are required to build and run this example, depending
on your OS, they may already be installed:

- Install node (v14 recommended)
- Install npm
- Install Rust v1.56.1 or later from https://rustup.rs/
- Install Solana v1.8.2 or later from
  https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools

If this is your first time using Rust, these [Installation
Notes](README-installation-notes.md) might be helpful.

### Configure CLI

> If you're on Windows, it is recommended to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run these commands

1. Set CLI config url to localhost cluster

```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```

2. Create CLI Keypair

If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```


### Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the on-chain program

There is both a Rust and C version of the on-chain program, whichever is built
last will be the one used when running the example.

```bash
npm run build:program-rust
```

```bash
npm run build:program-c
```

### Deploy the on-chain program

```bash
solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so
```

### Run the JavaScript client

```bash
npm run start
```

### Expected output

Public key values will differ:

```bash
Let's say hello to a Solana account...
Connection to cluster established: http://localhost:8899 { 'feature-set': 2045430982, 'solana-core': '1.7.8' }
Using account AiT1QgeYaK86Lf9kudqKthQPCWwpG8vFA1bAAioBoF4X containing 0.00141872 SOL to pay for fees
Using program Dro9uk45fxMcKWGb1eWALujbTssh6DW8mb4x8x3Eq5h6
Creating account 8MBmHtJvxpKdYhdw6yPpedp6X6y2U9dCpdYaZJdmwV3A to say hello to
Saying hello to 8MBmHtJvxpKdYhdw6yPpedp6X6y2U9dCpdYaZJdmwV3A
8MBmHtJvxpKdYhdw6yPpedp6X6y2U9dCpdYaZJdmwV3A has been greeted 1 times
Success
```


### Customizing the Program

To customize the example, make changes to the files under `/src`.  If you change
any files under `/src/program-rust` or `/src/program-c` you will need to
[rebuild the on-chain program](#build-the-on-chain-program) and [redeploy the program](#deploy-the-on-chain-program).

Now when you rerun `npm run start`, you should see the results of your changes.

## Pointing to a public Solana cluster

Solana maintains three public clusters:
- `devnet` - Development cluster with airdrops enabled
- `testnet` - Tour De Sol test cluster without airdrops enabled
- `mainnet-beta` -  Main cluster

Use the Solana CLI to configure which cluster to connect to.

To point to `devnet`:
```bash
solana config set --url devnet
```

To point back to the local cluster:
```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```
